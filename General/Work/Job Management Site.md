# Job Management Site
A possible mini project for job site management using Spring Boot can be a web-based application that aims to simplify and streamline the hiring process by allowing job seekers to apply for positions online, and employers to post job openings and manage applicants.

The following are some features that can be included in the project:
1. Job Management: Employers can add, modify or delete job postings through a user-friendly interface. Each job posting will include details like job title, job description, required qualifications, location, and salary range.
2. Applicant Tracking: Employers can view, sort and filter applications received for each job posting. They can also manage the hiring pipeline by marking applicants as shortlisted, interviewed, or hired.
3. Application Management: Job seekers can create a profile, attach their resumes, and apply to job postings with a single click. They can also track the status of their applications and receive automated notifications about the progress of their applications.
4. User Authentication: The application will have a secure login system with role-based access control, allowing employers to manage job postings and applications while keeping candidate information confidential.
5. Reporting: The application can generate reports and analytics to provide insights into the job site's performance, such as job posting status, applicant sources, or demographics of applicants.

## API Design
Here are some possible API endpoints for the job site management project using Spring Boot:

1. Job Management:
	- GET /jobs: retrieve a list of all job postings
	- GET /jobs/{id}: retrieve a specific job posting by ID
	- POST /jobs: create a new job posting
	- PUT /jobs/{id}: update an existing job posting by ID
	- DELETE /jobs/{id}: delete a job posting by ID

2. Applicant tracking:
	- GET /jobs/{id}/applications: retrieve all applications for a specific job posting
	- GET /jobs/{jobId}/applications/{appId}: retrieve a specific application by job and application IDs
	- PUT /jobs/{jobId}/applications/{appId}/status: update the status of an application for a specific job posting by ID

3. Application Management:
	- POST /applications: create a new application
	- GET /applications/{id}: retrieve a specific application by ID
	- DELETE /applications/{id}: delete an application by ID

4. User Authentication:
	- POST /login: authenticate user and provide access token
	- POST /logout: invalidate the access token and log the user out

5. Reporting:
	- GET /stats/job/{id}: retrieve statistics of a specific job posting
	- GET /stats/location: retrieve statistics by location
	- GET /stats/demographics: retrieve statistics by demographics
